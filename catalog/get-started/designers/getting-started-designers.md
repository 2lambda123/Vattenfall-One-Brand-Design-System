## Get started / Designers
In order to get started with Vattenfall Digital Design System, make sure you have been provided with both apps: Abstract and Sketch. Abstract is a version control tool, which keeps all of your Sketch working files in one place. It also prevents creating conflicting copies and allows contributors to request reviews and inspect the files without opening Sketch.

### Vattenfall Design Kit
The Vattenfall Design Kit (VDK) is a living library that contains Vattenfall's digital visual assets for everyday purpose: modules, components, icons, color palettes, grids, typography, etc. The purpose of VDK is to ensure design and development consistency across entire Vattenfall ecosystem, improve quality & efficiency in production, bring digital products & services to next level of coherency. The VDK can be accessed via Abstract in Sketch format and connected to your working design documents as a Sketch Library source.

### Design Kit Structure
The VDK structure is a nested library of symbols, grouped by type of module or component. The library contains more that 500 ready-to-use design snippets: from simple buttons to more complex modules. 

Make sure to study the component library and use components with correct naming. We use a simplified version of the Atomic Design methodology, adapted to suit our design process and our team culture. The main difference with Atomic Design is that all modules are either an atom or a molecule, categorised by purpose. Our approach to defining modules and naming them is function-directed, rather than presentational. It is based on evolving a shared design language collaboratively and empowering all designers and engineers on the team to contribute to the system.
