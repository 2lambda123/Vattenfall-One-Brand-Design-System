        large blocks of concrete that could, in the event of attack, be used to barricade the access, and the main entrance has
        a thick steel door allowing the plant to be isolated entirely from its surroundings. Luckily our guide, Thomas
        Wikström, Business Area Manager, Thermal Services in Vattenfall Services Nordic, has been entrusted with a passcode to
        let us in.

              ice-free harbour. They searched the entire Swedish west coast for a mountain that was large enough to hold big boilers,
              generators and equipment. The then small seaside holiday resort of Stenungsund turned out to meet all these
              requirements, and in 1956 the first detonations resounded in the otherwise peaceful archipelago in western Sweden. An
              impressive 1.5 million cubic metres – or three million tonnes – of rock were removed to make room for the power plant
              and its auxiliary systems.
