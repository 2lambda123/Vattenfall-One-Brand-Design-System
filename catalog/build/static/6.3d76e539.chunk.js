That means using an HTML5 doctype and including a viewport meta tag for proper responsive behaviors. Put it all together and your pages should look like this:\n\n```\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang="en">\n  <head>\n    \x3c!-- Required meta tags --\x3e\n    <meta charset="utf-8">\n    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">\n\n    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.vattenfall.com/design-system/css/1.0.0.css" crossorigin="anonymous">\n\n    <title>Hello, world!</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>\n\n    \x3c!-- Optional JavaScript --\x3e\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThat\'s all you need for overall page requirements. \n\n## Important globals\n\nBootstrap employs a handful of important global styles and settings that you\'ll need to be aware of when using it, all of which are almost exclusively geared towards the *normalization* of cross browser styles. Let\'s dive in.\n\n### HTML5 doctype\n\nBootstrap requires the use of the HTML5 doctype. Without it, you\'ll see some funky incomplete styling, but including it shouldn\'t cause any considerable hiccups.\n\n```\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang="en">\n  ...\n</html>\n```\n\n### Responsive meta tag\n\nBootstrap is developed *mobile first*, a strategy in which we optimize code for mobile devices first and then scale up components as necessary using CSS media queries. To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming for all devices, **add the responsive viewport meta tag** to your `<head>`.\n\n```\n<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">\n```\n\nYou can see an example of this in action in the [starter template](#starter-template).\n\n### Box-sizing\n\nFor more straightforward sizing in CSS, we switch the global `box-sizing` value from `content-box` to `border-box`. This ensures `padding` does not affect the final computed width of an element, but it can cause problems with some third party software like Google Maps and Google Custom Search Engine.\n\nOn the rare occasion you need to override it, use something like the following:\n\n```\n.selector-for-some-widget {\n  box-sizing: content-box;\n}\n```\n\nWith the above snippet, nested elements\u2014including generated content via `::before` and `::after`\u2014will all inherit the specified `box-sizing` for that `.selector-for-some-widget`.\n\nLearn more about [box model and sizing at CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/).\n\n### Reboot\n\nFor improved cross-browser rendering, we use [Reboot](/content/reboot/) to correct inconsistencies across browsers and devices while providing slightly more opinionated resets to common HTML elements.\n'}});
