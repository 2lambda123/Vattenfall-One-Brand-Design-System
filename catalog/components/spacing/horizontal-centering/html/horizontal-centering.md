### Horizontal centering

Additionally, the Vattenfall Digital Design System (DDS) also includes an `.mx-auto` class for horizontally centering fixed-width block level content. That is content that has `display: block` and a width setâ€”by setting the horizontal margins to `auto`.

```html
showSource: true
---
<div class="mx-auto" style="width: 200px;">
  Centered element
</div>
```
