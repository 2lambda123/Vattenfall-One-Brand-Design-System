## How it works

Assign responsive-friendly `margin` or `padding` values to an element or a subset of its sides with shorthand classes. Includes support for individual properties, all properties, and vertical and horizontal properties.

## Spacers

Vattenfall uses four default custom spacers called Small, Medium, Large and Extra Large.

The spacings are available as SCSS variables. They are named:

```
$spacing-sm // 28px
$spacing-md // 44px
$spacing-lg // 56px
$spacing-xl // 88px
```
