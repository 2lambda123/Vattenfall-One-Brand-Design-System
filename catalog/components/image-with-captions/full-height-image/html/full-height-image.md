### Full height image

If you require a full-height image, simply add the `vf-image-with-caption__image--full` class to the image.

```html
responsive: true
showSource: true
---
<figure class="vf-image-with-caption">
  <img class="vf-image-with-caption__image vf-image-with-caption__image--full" src="/img/example-article/illustration-bg.png" alt="Example image" />
  <figcaption class="vf-image-with-caption__caption">
    Standing in front of the huge, army green steel doors embedded in the granite mountain in Stenungsund, the proverbial magic words “open sesame” will be of no avail. What hides behind the doors was built to withstand attacks from foreign armies.
    <a class="vf-image-with-caption__share" href="#">Share</a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
```
