      <p>File uploaders allow users to upload content of their own. A file uploader is commonly found in forms, but can also live as a standalone element.</p>

        The icons mirror our typeface â€“ engineered and human, confident and determined.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are created to be simple, yet powerful, representations to ease and help understanding of our services, products and  ideas. Always used in moderation, and never animated, the icons can together with simple images create more clarity and messaging power than illustrations.
        Icons should always be in black when placed on a white or grey background. The same applies when icons are placed on other light background colors.
      </p>
      <p>
        When placed on an image - icons should primarily be white, but depending on the image they are also allowed to be black.
      </p>
      <p>
        When icons are in a group, use them in the same size to ensure that they have the same line weight
