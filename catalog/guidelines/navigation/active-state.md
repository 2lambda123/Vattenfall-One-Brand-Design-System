Navbar navigation links build on our `.vf-navigation__menu` options with their own modifier class and require the use of [togglerclasses](#toggler) for proper responsive styling.

**Navigation in navbars will also grow to occupy as much horizontal space as possible**
to keep your navbar contents securely aligned. Active states with`.active` to indicate the current page can be applied to their parent list `vf-navigation__menu-list-item`s. 

For level 2 `.active` can be applied to the sibling element `.vf-navigation__bottom-arrow` to apply the arrow styling.
