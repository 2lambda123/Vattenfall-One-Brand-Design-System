## Contribute to VDS
The VDS Guardian Team is committed to maintaining consistent, quality guidelines. We welcome all feedback, designs, or ideas in order to produce the best possible experience for our users. Below are our contribution models and best practices.

The Guardian Team consists of members with responsibility for development, design and copywriting at Vattenfall. Together they guard what goes into the design system to keep it nice and clean and in line with the Vattenfall brand.

To become a verified contributor you need to apply through branding@vattenfall.com.

Vattenfall Design System has three different levels of contribution. Click on the contribution level name to read more details about the workflow process for that particular level of contribution.

__Small__: A small design tweak (i.e. changing a border color)
__Medium__: Adding to/or changing guidelines, or contributing an icon
__Large__: Contributing a whole new component to the system

### Submitting an issue 
If you are not sure which model your contribution fits into, open an issue in one our repos and we will figure out which model it falls into.

### Not sure where to open an issue?
All contribution proposals should be opened in the VDS Trello Board. This includes small, medium, and large contributions (all components, icons, guideline updates, etc.).

Not sure how to submit an issue? Itâ€™s not so bad, we promise! Follow the Example here. @TODO add example

### Before you start
Every contribution must meet the same standards as VDS assets before it may be added to the system. Follow the guidelines below to ensure a smooth contribution process:

### Accessibility
Is your design WCAG AA accessible?
Does your design pass color contrast ratio?
Have you considered keyboard tabbing and focus states?

### Visual style and UX patterns
Is your design consistent with the default visual style established for the core VDS library?
Do your interaction patterns (hover, focus, motion) match VDS styles?
Does it use the same color and spacing tokens, as well as type styles and scale?
Does your design follow basic UX best practices?
Does your design promote clear language, correct grammar, and support globalization?

### Componentized
The components we accept into the global library need to work universally across products.
Have you tested this design for multiple use cases? It needs to be a pattern that all teams can utilize and global enough to fit use cases for other teams.
Is there a similar component in the library that already exists?
What are the advantages of this pattern over alternative patterns?
