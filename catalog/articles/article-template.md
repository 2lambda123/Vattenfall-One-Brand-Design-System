## A Digital Design System for the future

The decision to build our own DDS was based on the realization that meeting specific organizational needs is required to achieve economies of scale. Our internal review and the very valuable user feedback we've received so far form the basis for our mission to create a better system and user experience going forward. Furthermore, building our own DDS enables us to support regional initiatives whilst retaining control over the development roadmap. All in all, this means building for the future and being able to excel in creating high return on marketing efforts.

### Onwards and upwards in phases

Enhancements and new features to the DDS are conducted in a systematic phased approach and updates are released continuously in batches. The new design system will be taken beyond Sketch and Abstract to work for everyone.

### A collaborative approach

While global brand consistency is important, it’s also important to acknowledge local needs in different markets. We’re working on a list of requirements and would love feedback and/or questions from all users on what would help them most to make this a truly collaborative Design System. Thank you for your input!
