Being a fast-moving medium with very little patience or viewing time, we need to balance and prioritise between message (clarity) and sender (identification).

        <h2>Social Media</h2>
        <p>
          Our social media platforms are amongst our most important communication channels, and a consistent brand expression through all of them is key to gaining instant brand recognition. Within Vattenfall, there are many owners and publishers in social media, equally many external partners who contribute. In social media, we are never more than a scroll away from seeing multiple posts and messages from our brand and we want them to look and feel the same. To avoid a potential risk of inconsistent executions, we should all use the right templates.

          <h2>Video & Motion</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          A lot of Vattenfall’s storytelling is done through video with the support of other motion elements. Motion ID is how we translate the Vattenfall identity into everything that is moving – imagery, icons, infographics, film footage, and how these are blended, mixed, and edited together with other assets to create a singular feel for the brand. This ensures that we emphasise the same emotional response around who we want to be.
