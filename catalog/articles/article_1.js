					The Digital Design System (DDS) exists to help us create user-focused digital experiences that are
					distinctly Vattenfall. The goal is to ensure brand consistency – to present a cohesive and compliant
					experience of Vattenfall to the world through all digital channels which in the end will generate
					more sales.

				<h3>Benefits of brand consistency</h3>
				<p className="pt-2">
					The most obvious benefit of brand consistency is immediate brand recognition; building a strong
					association between Vattenfall’s core messages and the visual elements of the brand. And, ultimately
					getting the most impact and best results from our work – no matter if you’re in sales, brand or
					another business area.
					Nowadays, most of the Fortune 500 companies’ stock value is largely constituted by brand equity
					wherein brand consistency is one of the key factors for a strong brand. For
					high-involvement-utilitarian global brands like Vattenfall, brand consistency is an integral aspect
					of building relationships with current and future customers.

							Done right, brand consistency on a global level increases perceived quality, which in turn
							increases sales likelihood. In fact, brand consistency muffles price sensitivity and
							increases marketing effectiveness – brand consistency throughout the customer journey is
							proved to have the potential to lift revenue by 15% and save costs for serving customers
							with 20%.
							In Vattenfall’s business, it basically comes down to this: Economies of scale. Using the
							assets that are produced centrally will mean increased brand consistency globally and
							therefore sales, while also requiring less cost of producing those same assets locally.
